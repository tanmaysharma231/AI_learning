It enhances the ability of language models to provide factual responses, which is a limitation of classical setups.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a question-answering bot for movie-related questions. To achieve this, we will use RAG to provide factual information to the language model. We will upload movie descriptions to a vector database and use it to search for relevant context for the language model.\n\nWe will be using the following tools and models:\n- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for prompt completions\n- OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to create vector embeddings\n- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) as the vector database to store the embeddings\n- [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) as the tool to interact with OpenAI and Pinecone\n\nThe dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [IMDb Movies/Shows with Descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/imdb-data-with-descriptions).","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Maintenance note, May 2024\n\nSince this code-along was released, the Python packages for working with the Pinecone and OpenAI APIs have changed their syntax.

Creating embeddings is a form of dimensionality reduction, where we assign the text to a point in an N-dimensional space. Texts that are semantically close to each other should end up being close to each other in the N-dimensional space.\n\nLuckily, OpenAI has several models that are trained to calculate these kinds of embeddings, so we don't have to do that ourselves. Of course, a cost is associated with this. You can derive the cost from the [pricing page of OpenAI](https://openai.com/pricing).\n\nThe calculation is based on the amount of _tokens_ in the text. All text is encoded into tokens to be used by OpenAI. On average, a token consists of roughly 3 characters. However, we can calculate the exact tokens for a string of text by using the `tiktoken` package.\n\nThe goal of this task is to calculate the number of tokens in the documents, to then extrapolate the estimated cost.","metadata":{},"id":"a8f9087b-d05a-4e4a-a7e7-0e3b13ce8b5d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions","metadata":{},"id":"1d29906f-89e9-499e-846b-b69b94920413","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"- Import `tiktoken`\n- Create the encoder, use the `\"cl100k_base\"` encoder.

In this task, we'll need to:\n\n1. Generate vector embeddings for all documents in `docs`. We'll utilize OpenAI for this purpose. langchain provides a convenient helper for this task, `langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings`, which you can use to generate embeddings using the latest `text-embedding-ada-002` model.\n2. Populate the vector index in Pinecone with these embeddings. Fortunately, langchain also offers assistance with this through the [`langchain.vectorstores.Pinecone`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone) helper.\n\nThese two steps can be combined using the convenient helper method `.from_document` of the `Pinecone` class. This method accepts an embedding model as input and efficiently calculates the embeddings, subsequently uploading them to Pinecone. We will also introduce some control flow to the code to ensure we do not add data to the Pinecone index if it already contains data. To achieve this, we can make use of the `.from_existing_index` method of `Pinecone`.\n\nIn addition to storing vectors, Pinecone allows the storage of additional metadata. When using the langchain helpers, it automatically assumes that vectors should be created from the `page_content` property of each `Document`. All other properties will be included as metadata.\n\nYou can verify that everything has worked correctly by accessing the `imdb-movies` index in the Pinecone UI.\n\n1. ![Pinecone UI showing the imdb-movies index](pinecone_ui_index.png)","metadata":{},"id":"9ea4d375-28be-4deb-a11d-960215c13589","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions\n\n- From the `langchain_openai` package, import `OpenAIEmbeddings`.\n- From the `langchain_pinecone` package, import `PineconeVectorStore`.\n- Create the embeddings object.\n- Create an index from its name.","metadata":{},"id":"290c64c4-c5d2-426f-bb71-2d98fdd2d89c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# From the langchain_openai package, import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\n# From the langchain_pinecone package, import PineconeVectorStore\nfrom langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore\n\n# Create the embeddings object\nembeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\n# Create an index from its name\nindex= pc.Index(index_name)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":99,"lastExecutedAt":1748043865923,"lastExecutedByKernel":"88e9d58f-ae45-4093-bb04-fd2799721301","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# From the langchain_openai package, import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\n# From the langchain_pinecone package, import PineconeVectorStore\nfrom langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore\n\n# Create the embeddings object\nembeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\n# Create an index from its name\nindex= pc.Index(index_name)"},"id":"d31de2ab-bc68-402e-a61b-350de59246f0","cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Instructions\n\nFill the index. _Some control flow is provided._\n\n- Count the number of vectors in the index.

It is crucial to always consider the data provided to the system and interpret the results of the AI system within that context. To enhance the results, one approach could be to include information about the movie quality in the movie description.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of RAG is the ability to provide relevant context to the LLM within the prompt itself.

When a paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley, becomes determined to destroy the robot, Hogarth and beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.) must do what they can to save the misunderstood machine.\nIMDB link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: 'The Iron Giant' is an animated movie about a friendship between a robot and a kid.
